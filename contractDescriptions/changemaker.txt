1. Ownable
When the ChangeMaker contract is deployed (from withing the ChangeDao contract), the owner of the ChangeMaker contract is set as the address of the ChangeDao contract.


2. Initialization
The deployed ChangeMaker contract is used for generating clones.  When a clone is created it first calls an initialization function.

a) state variable
changeDao
cloneOwner

b) initialize()
This sets the value of 1) the changeDao address and 2) the cloneOwner (the address that owns the ChangeMaker clone).

Q1) What should be the name and symbol for the ChangeMaker NFT?


3. Project
a) state variable
projectImplementation
projectClones
projectTokenId

b) constructor
i) The ChangeMaker contract is created as an ERC721 contract.
ii) A new Project.sol contract is deployed and its address is stored as projectImplementation (this will be used to make clone contracts).

c) createProject()
parameters: i) expirationTime, ii) fundingGoal, iii) minimumSponsorship
A changeMaker calls this function to create a project clone based on the function parameters.
A new NFT is created that connects the changeMaker to the project clone.
