1. Ownable
When the ChangeMaker contract is deployed (from withing the ChangeDao contract), the owner of the ChangeMaker contract is set as the address of the ChangeDao contract.


2. Initialization
The deployed ChangeMaker contract is used for generating clones.  When a clone is created it first calls an initialization function.

a) state variable
changeDao (address)

b) initialize()
This sets the value of the changeDao address within the ChangeMaker clone.

projectClones

b) constructor
i) The ChangeMaker contract is created as an ERC721 contract.
