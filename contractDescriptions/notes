1.  Some variables are public for testing.  Should they be changed to private and have the tests re-written?

2. Will ChangeMaker and Project need an admin?

3. ChangeMaker does not need to be ownable because there are no functions on the implementation that need access control.  All of the access control happens for the clones, which is set in the initializer.

4. Fallback/receive functions for all contracts. Does there need to be a function to withdraw eth that ends up in a contract through the fallback/receive funtions?

5. Are the funding types only eth, usdc and dai?
